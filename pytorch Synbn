With Synbn: 
  net = torch.nn.SyncBatchNorm.convert_sync_batchnorm(net).to(device)
Each device can have same running_mean and running var, these buffer is always same rather than only after 'forward' method, 
means process using global data to do BN.

Note: "broadcast_buffers=True" only ensure buffer is same after forward, but not ensure is same at each time.
